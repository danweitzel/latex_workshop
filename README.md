# LaTeX Workshop Materials – Colorado State University  

This repository contains the materials for the LaTeX workshop at Colorado State University. The workshop introduces students to **LaTeX** and **Beamer**, covering file setup, writing LaTeX code, and automating the integration of tables and figures generated in **R**.  

## Repository Structure  

### `manuscript/`  
Contains `manuscript.tex` and three subfolders:  
- **`chapters/`** – Stores individual chapter files.  
- **`figures/`** – Holds figure files referenced in the manuscript.  
- **`tables/`** – Includes tables generated for the manuscript.  
- *`manuscript.tex` demonstrates how to structure a LaTeX document and link figures, tables, and chapters from these subfolders.*  

### `scripts/`  
Includes an **R script** that generates a table and a graph using data from the **2020 ANES Pilot Study**, which are then automatically integrated into the LaTeX document.  

### `resources/`  
Provides additional materials, including:  
- **`bibliography/`** – Contains the **APSR** citation style file and an example `.bib` file.  
- **Snippets** for **Sublime Text** to assist with LaTeX coding.  
- **Templates** for Beamer presentations and manuscript writing.
